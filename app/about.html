          <p>The Ministry Center is a Christian based ministry sponsored by Tulsa area churches.
          <p>The Ministry Center began as the Tulsa Baptist Ministry Center during the 1980's.  Following a devastating fire in 1998, the center was rebuilt under the volunteer direction of Allan Davis.  When the rebuilding was completed in May of 2000, the center was reopened and renamed The Allan Davis Ministry Center.  In 2007 the ministry was renamed one more time to its current name, The Ministry Center at the Allan Davis Building.
          <p>In <strong>2013</strong>, over <strong>12,000 people were helped</strong> through this ministry.
          <h2>No Such Thing as a Coincidence!</h2>
          <p>At The Ministry Center (TMC), we don’t believe in coincidences, only “God-cidences”. God-cidences are those happenings that you know without a doubt were orchestrated by God. A specific God-cidence happened at the last medical clinic held at The Ministry Center. . . . .
          <p>A 37-year old single mother of five had made an appointment for her fiance at TMC's medical clinic. She nagged him into coming, as she knew his health was bad. She failed, however, to schedule one for herself. She had been off of her blood pressure meds for over a year, as she couldn’t afford the cost to see a doctor. She “controlled” her pressure by taking an aspiring and lying down when she felt her blood pressure might be high. She had been trying to get into the Indian Health Clinic but had not been successful. We scheduled an appointment for her at our next clinic which was in two weeks.
          <p>As she was sitting with her fiancé speaking with one of our intake interviewers, she had a strong and immediate episode and felt very sick. When we took her blood pressure it was 220 over 140! She was taken immediately to see our clinic doctor, where she was treated and given the life-saving meds that she needed. Our physician indicated that she probably would have died or had a stroke before the next clinic, had she not been treated that day.
          <p>Was it a coincidence that this woman had a strong, immediate episode at the very time she was at The Ministry Center, while a doctor was there? Absolutely not. It was a God-cidence.
